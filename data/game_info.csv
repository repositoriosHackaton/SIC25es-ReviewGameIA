The player slowly advances from one point of contact to another, defeating more and more powerful enemies. Completing the game is a truly hard task with the first, one of the main features of the series - a constant repetition and search for better tactics to overcome a certain enemy.

Dark Souls II,"Dark Souls II is the third installment in the well-known Souls series. It’s a different game from all the others because of its directors. With Dark Souls II the main director and founder of Souls-like genre Hidetaka Miyazaki took place only as a supervisor of the project, leaving a place of the director of the game for two young video game designers Tomohiro Shibuya and Yui Tanimura. One could ask if the game is as good and beautiful as other past games in the Series and the answer would be that Dark Souls II is different yet deep and unforgiving as all the other titles in the series. The famous difficulty of previous games is still there but the world is much simpler yet connected and dangerous. Enemies still respond after death of a player but only about 15 times. After that they disappear forever. Boss battles are much simpler, this time focuses on many simpler bosses at a time instead of one powerful boss. 

Dark Souls II is one of those games which were painfully downgraded in a favor of hardware of consoles, that means that players got less graphically advanced version than promised. Yet the game is interesting and deep and it’s definitely a must play for every Souls fan.",2014-03-11,

The single-player campaign invites players to go through the episodic story, where players control six different characters.

Multiplayer side of things in the Call of Duty series has been more popular among the players. A lot of features, not present in the single-player campaign, will be available to the player, such as a killstreak mechanic, that rewards players for killing multiple enemies without dying. Multiplayer maps consist of team-based and deathmatch based game modes, where players take on the objectives in order to complete the map mission or to obtain the largest amount of kills.

The fighting system is very flexible. Choosing from three different styles, you can adapt Geralt for any kind of a combat situation. Fast style of fighting gives you an opportunity to strike your opponents with your speed. The strong style focuses itself on destroying your enemies with powerful attacks, while sweeping style is very good when facing a number of foes. You can also craft some potions to gain important benefits such as seeing in the dark or having a larger amount HP. Plot style is unique as well.

With Dark Souls II the main director and founder of Souls-like genre Hidetaka Miyazaki took place only as a supervisor of the project, leaving a place of the director of the game for two young video game designers Tomohiro Shibuya and Yui Tanimura.

The famous difficulty of previous games is still there but the world is much simpler yet connected and dangerous. Enemies still respond after death of a player but only about 15 times. After that they disappear forever. Boss battles are much simpler, this time focuses on many simpler bosses at a time instead of one powerful boss.

Battlefield V,"Battlefield V is the sixteenth game in its franchise. 

Plot

Like the original Battlefield, the game is based on the real events of World War II. The game focuses on the obscure battles of the war. It features storylines that tie the battles together and consist of episodes called “war stories”.

Gameplay

Battlefield V puts a strong emphasis on realism. The game avoids video game abstractions in favor of immersive experience of the war. For that goal, the game aims to increase the player's interaction with the environment, such as doors, vehicles, or ammo. The ammo and other resources in the game are scarce, forcing the player to use a tactical approach.

The game gives a spotlight to women in the military who are among the main characters in the campaign. The player might also choose to play a female character in the multiplayer, as the gender is not tied to a class. The game also allows the players many customization options for costumes, vehicles, and weapons.

Modes

Battlefield V has many multiplayer modes, some of which are new to the series and some are reimagined versions of the modes from previous games. For example, The Grand Operations mode is based on the original Battlefield mode called Operations. This mode imitates a military campaign and consists of a series of battles with different objectives and non-linear progress options.",2018-11-20,

Driven by pure revenge, nothing can stop Kratos from achieving absolution.",2005-03-22,
God of War III,"The final part of the original trilogy about Kratos, who is on the mission to revenge his loved ones and who killed the god of war and took his place. The game is exclusive for PlayStation 3 and 4.

God of War III is a typical action-adventure slasher. The game is the seventh in the series, it is a direct continuation of God of War II story. The main elements of the game are borrowed from ancient Greek mythology. The player controls Kratos - who lost his place on Olympus this time. Together with the goddess of the land of Gaia, he climbs Mount Olympus to defeat Zeus but fails and thrown into the waters of the River Styx. The plot narrates about the ascent of the main character back to the tops.

From the gameplay point of view the game is not much different from the previous parts. This is also an action packed third-person slasher with RPG elements and handcrafted cinematics. In the hands of Kratos, two blades, whose possibilities can be improved for in-game currency, other weapons will be available as the passage progresses. All levels of the game end with boss battles with heavy use of Quick-Time-Events.",2010-03-16,
God of War II,"The second installment in the God of War franchise and exclusive for the Sony PlayStation 2 console. The game uses basics from the hack-and-slash genre, like its predecessor, and was developed by Santa Monica studio, which is a subsidiary of Sony Entertainment. The game is recognized as one of the best for the console from Sony and the best game in action genre in 2007. The game was released on Sony Playstation 2 already at the moment when the third version of the console was already selling for four months. The developers explained their decision: one hundred million people already playing on PlayStation 2, whereas on the next-generation console gamers were just going to adopt the new hardware.

Key features

The player controls Kratos, who in the first part killed the god of war Ares and took his place. The game heavily relies on the ancient Greek mythology and uses it as inspiration and the main source for enemies and NPC design as well as locations design. However, the game is not a great source of accurate historical facts: Ancient Greece history was rewritten for the sake of the genre and the game universe, the rules of which were established in the first part.

The story

King of the gods Zeus betrays Kratos and kills him, but the Spartan is saved from the Underworld by another goddess Gaia, who invites Kratos to find the Sisters of Fate and go to the past and prevent his own murder. The gameplay remained the same: the player can use several attacks, which can be combined and improved with the help of the in-game currency collected from enemies. The game has a lot of Quick-Time-Events, mostly they are used in battles with bosses and in finishing combo-moves. Bosses in the game, in comparison with the first part, significantly increased.",2007-03-13,
Red Dead Redemption,"Red Dead Redemption is a third-person open-world adventure game which implements the Wild West at its best: it is very much GTA-clone but in bizarre stylistics and the very beginning of the twentieth century. This is the second title of a franchise, being preceded by Red Dead Revolver and followed by Red Dead Redemption 2 coming out in late 2018. 

We play as John Marston who gradually takes down and take out criminals and those, who crosses his path. Among the combat mechanics, the most interesting one is ""Dead Eye"" — it allows one to point multiple targets out in slow motion and then shoot them simultaneously. 

The game features 16-players multiplayer and cooperative and also has zombie DLC — Undead Nightmare. Additional content adds two modes to the original game: undead overrun in which you have to survive an infinite amount of zombie waves, and Land Grab in which player has to defend the particular piece of land to gain control of it.",2010-05-18,

Red Dead Redemption,"Red Dead Redemption es un juego de aventura de mundo abierto en tercera persona que implementa el Salvaje Oeste en su mejor momento: es mucho GTA-clone pero en estilística bizarra y el comienzo mismo del siglo XX. Este es el segundo título de una franquicia, siendo precedido por Red Dead Revolver y seguido por Red Dead Redemption 2 que sale a finales de 2018.

Jugamos como John Marston que gradualmente derriba y derriba a criminales y a aquellos que se cruzan en su camino. Entre los mecánicos de combate, el más interesante es ""Ojo Muerto"" — permite a uno señalar múltiples objetivos a cámara lenta y luego dispararles simultáneamente.

El juego cuenta con 16 jugadores multijugador y cooperativo y también tiene zombie DLC — Undead Nightmare. Contenido adicional añade dos modos al juego original: invasión de no-muertos en el que tienes que sobrevivir a una cantidad infinita de olas zombies, y Land Grab en el que el jugador tiene que defender la parte particular de la tierra para ganar el control de ella.",2010-05-18,
Overcooked,"Sobrecocido pone al jugador en los zapatos de dos chefs de restaurante a la vez. Cada nivel es una cocina, y su objetivo es cocinar una lista de comidas siguiendo las recetas en pantalla. El tiempo es limitado, y hay restricciones en cuanto a la cantidad de dinero que el jugador puede gastar en los ingredientes. El jugador controla dos caracteres que se pueden cambiar en cualquier momento u ordenar para hacer una lista de acciones.

Las cocinas se colocan a menudo en lugares extraños, como un barco pirata, dos camiones de velocidad, un cruce peatonal, o un iceberg. Los elementos de nivel son dinámicos y pueden moverse o cambiar durante el juego. Mesas y hornos pueden deslizarse, y los cocineros pueden caer del nivel, aunque se reaparecerá en breve.

Hay un modo de historia en el que la cocina está ligada a la trama. El juego está ambientado en el Reino de la Cebolla que fue atacado por un monstruo de espaguetis insaciable. Los chefs viajan en el tiempo para refinar sus habilidades de cocina y alimentar al monstruo cuando aparece de nuevo.

Ya que incluso en el modo único el jugador tiene que controlar a dos cocineros, el juego tiene previsiblemente un multijugador cooperativo y un modo competitivo en el que los jugadores tratan de “superarse” entre sí. Ambos modos, sin embargo, son locales, y no hay multijugador en línea.",2016-08-01,

Detroit: Become Human,"En el mundo futuro, los androides hacen casi todo lo que la gente hace - incluso comienzan a pensar y sentir. Aunque nadie les enseñó esto.

La trama de ""Conviértete en humano"" está construida alrededor de tres personajes, cada uno con una historia separada, pero finalmente se fusionan en una sola imagen.

Connor es un investigador de la policía y androide. Tiene una tarea sencilla - encontrar androides, desviados del camino dado por los humanos. Tiene una visión especial, que le permite ver los acontecimientos como sucedieron. Y cuanto más información recopila, mayores son sus posibilidades de actuar correctamente.

Kara es una ama de casa androide que desarrolla espontáneamente la autoconciencia. Como resultado, Kara asume la responsabilidad del destino de la niña para la que trabajaba como niñera. Ella, junto con la niña, escapa de la casa como resultado de un conflicto con su padre, el dueño de Kara.

Markus es un androide cuidador. También adquirió la autoconciencia y llegó a la idea de que los androides necesitan libertad. Él tiene la capacidad de conceder a los androides el libre albedrío y calcular las consecuencias de algunas acciones.

La historia se desarrolla dependiendo de las decisiones tomadas por los personajes. Algunas decisiones tienen que ser tomadas rápidamente. A veces un jugador puede volver al momento de tomar una decisión y reproducir la situación.",2018-05-25,
Subnautica,"Subnautica es un juego en primera persona sobre la supervivencia en el mar profundo. Usted controla Ryley Robinson, un viajero espacial en el siglo 22, que aterrizó su nave estelar en un planeta que está cubierto casi por completo por el océano. El protagonista necesita comer y beber, aunque esto puede ser deshabilitado en modos de dificultad más baja. Puede desalinizar el agua oceánica, coger o recoger los mariscos, y crear herramientas y estructuras útiles. A diferencia de muchos juegos de supervivencia, Subnautica tiene una trama detallada, en la que Ryley tiene que descubrir por qué su barco se estrelló. Explorando el océano, encontrando los restos de otros choques, y escuchando los mensajes de radio, Robinson aprenderá acerca de la enorme Leviathan, los misteriosos Precursores, y la razón por la que este planeta está en cuarentena.

El juego es famoso por su espectacular representación del océano y su fauna. Robinson está equipado con un equipo de buceo que permite al jugador pasar la mayor parte del juego bajo el agua, aunque el oxígeno todavía tiene que ser reabastecido. El jugador puede bucear profundamente y explorar el mundo lleno de corales, peces y otras criaturas marinas coloridas, a menudo grotescas o bioluminiscentes. El entorno se genera al azar para mejorar la rejugabilidad.",2018-01-23,
